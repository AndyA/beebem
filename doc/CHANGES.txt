Version 0.5
-----------
Improved timing - mode 7 bodged to exactly correct cycle count
Interlace timing accounted for in modes 0-6.
Interrupt latency added
fixed window.cc (took out 'virtual' on most functions) - now OK in gcc 2.7.0
Changed default position of g++ includes to /usr/include/g++

Version 0.6
-----------
A few fiddles with the config for linux - now compiles on 2.7.0 with the ELF-GCC
release; but could cause probs for older releases.

Stated adding sound card.

Version 0.7 (Mike Wyatt)
-----------
Added conditional compilation for all the Microsoft Windows code. Should only
need to maintain one set of source files for both the X and MS Win versions.

Changed sound code so it does not play a sound until both the high and low
bytes of the frequency have been set (eliminates spurious high pitch beeps).

Video module now generates a cursor.

Implemented a load of undocumented 6502 instructions.

Directed read and writes to the 16 bytes above each VIA back down to
the VIAs (Castle Quest uses the higher addresses).

Added the atodconv module to provide Analogue to Digital support.  Added the
beebstate module to provide Save and Restore of Beeb State files.  These two
new modules should compile under UNIX but there is currently no code in the
X Windows version to use them.

MS Windows version now provides:
  Load of menus to control everything
  Dynamic disc selection
  Beeb State save and restore
  Various Window sizes
  Real time and fixed frame rate modes
  Sound support
  Joystick support
  Mousestick support
  ROM write protection
  Multiple ROM initialisation
  Games keyboard mapping
  Pentium optimised version

Version 0.71 (Mike Wyatt)
------------
Changed VIA timer latches initial value to 0xffff (Castle Quest now works).

Fixed BCD addition and substraction and prevented mode 7 code from dividing
by zero (Exile now works).

Changed VIA code so the data direction registers can be read (Codename Droid
now works).

Fixed cursor colour in UNIX version.

Added sideways RAM support (so Exile can be played full screen).


Version 0.8 (Mike Wyatt & Laurie Whiffen)
-----------
Added disc write and format capability.

Changed disc load code to give a warning if disc image loaded looks like its
been loaded using wrong type (single/doubled sided).

MS Windows version only:
  Fixed so all key presses are released when windows looses focus.
  Rom slots can be individually changed between ROM and RAM using the menus.
  Added user definable keyboard mapping options.
  User preferences (including the keyboard mapping) can be saved in an INI
    file using a new menu option.
  Added menu options for write protection and creating new disc images.


Version 0.9 (Mike Wyatt)
-----------
Added AMX mouse support.

Converted to use DirectX and added a full screen option.

Fixed a few bugs (thanks to Piers Haken for pointing out a bug in the video
code).


Version 1.0 (Mike Wyatt)
-----------
Switchable DirectDraw and DirectSound.
Fixed Windows message boxes when using DirectDraw.
Printer support.
Improved ROM size checking.
Improved speed regulation code.

Version 1.01 (Mike Wyatt)
------------
Fixes the problem with BeebEm hanging after about 35 minutes. 

Version 1.02 (Mike Wyatt)
------------
Added Robert's Freeze when Inactive option.

Version 1.03 (Robert Schmidt)
------------
Windows update only:
Monochrome monitor/B&W TV emulation

Version 1.04 (Robert Schmidt)
------------
Windows update only:
* Remember last used directories for disc images and emulator states.
* Dialog for opening disc images has 3 new filters:
	- Automatic *.ssd/*.dsd detection
	- *.ssd only
	- *.dsd only
* Support for higher DirectDraw resolutions, through new sub menu.
  (1280x1024 makes aliasing effects unnoticable, but requires a fast
  DirectDraw implementation.)
* Added option to use 32-bit DirectDraw modes in full screen, as opposed
  to 8-bit. (In a window, DirectDraw uses the desktop color depth.)
  When combined with "Buffer in video RAM", the result is a *superior*, 
  interpolated display!  Scaling artifacts "disappear" at any resolution.
* Made "Full Screen" a toggle, not a standalone mode/"window size".
* Fixed a bug that didn't show speed/FPS in a windowed DirectDraw mode.

  Added all documented 65C12 Opcodes extra to the 6502
  Added _simple_ 1770 FDC - Read only at present
  Made some hardware re-arrange to alternate locations on a Master
  (The A to D convertor is accessed the same, but at a different location)

  of Elite
* Added writable option for ROMS in the roms.cfg file
* Modified roms.cfg handling to save having to re-edit between releases
* Minor Master 128 memory handling bug corrected

* Added some more fixed speed settings (you can now play Elite at a 
  decent speed!).
* Put quick load and save back the right way!
* Add a link to the README file to the help menu.
* Changed keyboard maps to default and logical layouts.  The default 
  mapping is the same as the old mapping 1.  Logical mapping maps symbol
  by symbol (for a UK PC keyboard at least) so you get what you press.
* Added keyboard mapping options for A & S and function keys.

* Added disc settings to the UEF state.  When a state is restored BeebEm
  will load the disc images that were loaded when the state was stored.
* Fixed various bugs in the video emulation (fixes Psycastria and Level 9
  graphical adventures, improves FireTrack).
* Changed video emulation so that *TV255 does not move screen down (*TV254 
  does though). Some programs do a *TV255 and the bottom line of the screen

  infamous "Kevin Edwards" protection code!  The following tapes now load 
  and run:
    Knight Lore, Alien 8, Daley Thompson Supertest, Strykers Run,
    Exile, Joust, Galaforce
  These are the only ones I've tried, others may work as well.
* Fixed bug in horizontal displayed register emulation.  Joust tape loading
  screen now appears centered correctly.
* Fixed bug in virtical sync position register emulation.  Stops DirectX 
  errors occurring when running Micropower Roulette.
* Fixed bug in virtical displayed/total register emulation for mode 7.
  Screen is now cleared below lines that are displayed.
* Added AVI video capture to the file menu (now with resolution and frame
  skip options).
* Changed command line parsing so it works when paths are enclosed in 
  quotes and it now supports loading of UEF state files (thanks to Jasper
  for this one).  Disk and state files can now be associated with BeebEm
  and run by double clicking on them.
* Fixed bug in IDE hard disk file access that prevented BeebEm from running
  when logged in as an unprivileged user on Windows XP.
* Fixed bug with window positioning when task bar is on left or top of 
  screen.
* Bumped version to 3.0 to keep in sync with the Mac version of BeebEm.

Version 3.1 (Mike Wyatt, Rob O'Donnell, Jon Welch)
-----------
* Added econet emulation.  It works in Model B mode and Master 128 mode.
  The Acorn level 1 and 2 file server software runs and stations can 
  read/write files to the server.  Note that the default DFS ROM in Model B
  mode has been changed to the Acorn DNFS ROM.
  (Note also that TORCHNET works using the Torch Z80 Co-Processor)
* Added some more command line options.  The hardware model and tube support
  can be specified on the command line.  See the notes in readme.txt.
* Fixed default read value for IO pages FRED and JIM.  Fixes graphics
  corruption in tape version of Alien 8.

* Fixed econet station allocation on PCs with multiple network
  interfaces/cards (thanks to Sam Skivington).
* Added keyboard shortcuts for Quicksave (keypad /) & Quickload (keypad *).
  Quicksave now keeps the last 10 quicksave files so you can go back to an
  earlier state using the load state menu option.
* Changed to ignore DirectX errors during screen update.  Stops BeebEm 
  reporting an error when switching between a full and non-full screen mode
  instances of BeebEm.  DirectX appears to sort itself out after a second 
  or two!
* Fixed disk initialisation in the 1770 controller when creating a new disk
  image.
* Fixed disk formatting with the 1770 controller.
